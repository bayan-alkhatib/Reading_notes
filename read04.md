# A B C  of programing:
## What is a script and how do I create one?
A script is a series of instructions that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.
To write a script, you need to firststate your goal and then list the tasks that need to be completed in
order to achieve it.
* DEFINE THE GOAL
* DESIGN THE SCRIPT
* CODE EACH STEP
to interact with JS you need to know:
Vocabulary
Syntax

***You need to learn to "think" like a computer because they solve tasks in different ways than you or I might approach them.***
Computers solve problems programmatically; they follow series of instructions, one after another.
