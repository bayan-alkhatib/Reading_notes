# THE DOCUMENT OBJECT : 

Using the document object, you can access and change what content users see on the page and respond to how they interact with it.
is just one of a set of bjects that all major browsers support. 

## The document object has: 
* PROPERTIES 
* METHODS 
* EVENTS 

## How a browser interprets the HTML code and applies styling to it?

1. RECEIVE A PAGE AS HTML CODE.
2. CREATE A MODEL OF THE PAGE AND STORE IT IN MEMORY.
3. USE A RENDERING ENGINE TO SHOW THE PAGE ON SCREEN using CSS. 
4. use a JavaScript interpreter to translate your instructions (in JavaScript) into instructions the computer can follow. 

## Notes: 
languages that are used to create web pages: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 

keep the three languages in separate files, with the HTML page linking to CSS and JavaScript files. 

Each language forms a separate layer with a different purpose. Each layer builds on the previous one. 

When the browser comes across a "script" element, it stops to load the script and then checks to see if it needs to do anything.


JAVASCRIPT IS Case sensitive.

STATEMENTS ARE INSTRUCTIONS AND EACH ONE STARTS O N A NEW LINE.

STATEMENTS CAN BE ORGANIZED INTO CODE BLOCKS 

You should write comments to explain what your code does. They help make your code easier to read and understand. This can help you and others who read your code. 

A script will have to temporarily st ore the bits of info rmation it needs to do its j ob. It can store t his data in variables the data stored in a variable can change (or vary) each time a script runs. 


 ## Learning to read and write JavaScript: 

THE LANGUAGE: SYNTAX AND GRAMMAR; like any new language, there are new words to learn (the vocabulary) and ru les for how these can be put toget 
her (the grammar and syntax of the language). 

GIVING INSTRUCTIONS: FOR A BROWSER TO FOLLOW Web browsers (and computers in general) approach tasks in a very different way than a human might. 
Your instructions need to reflect how computers get things done. 
 
DATA TYPES: 

NUMERIC DATA TYPE.

STRING DATA TYPE.
