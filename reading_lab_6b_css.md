# Chapter 10

## What CSS does?
* CSS1 was released in 1996 and CSS2 followed two years later. Work on
CSS3 has been ongoing but the major browsers have already started to
implement it.
* CSS rules usually appear in a separate document, although they may appear within an HTML page. CSS allows you to create rules that control the way that each individual box (and the contents of that box) is presented.
* Different types of selectors allow you to target your rules at different elements.
* CSS works by associating rules with HTML elements. These rules govern
how the content of specified elements should be displayed. A CSS rule
contains two parts: a selector and a declaration.

## CSS Properties Affect How Elements are Displayed:
CSS declarations sit inside curly brackets and each is made up of two
parts: a property and a value, separated by a colon. You can specify
several properties in one declaration, each separated by a semi-colon.
