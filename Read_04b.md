# Computer:
A computer is a machine created by humans to help us in the thinking work.
## thinking process of computer:
* input
* storage
* processing
* output

a computer atarted s a calculator.
computer consists of wires and circuites that carry all the information in a computor.
the base behind (0 1) or binary system of data comunication inside th computer is the electrical wire  signale (on or off).
numbers, text,images,sounds, videos are all converted and stored in binary system inside the computer.
circuits: are tiny compenents that used to combine inpute data and converted to output.
computer intract with the world by inputs and outputs, this hhappens by the he;p of memory,cpu and speed.
the more complex the information is the more speed, operations,and memory needed.
hardware and software interacting with each other to give us the computer.
 we use software programing languages to contact with computer binary system, and so operate and process its own function.
 
 ## Operating system :
 is the master program that manages how software uses the hardware of a computer.
 
 <*codeing allows you to define the problem you want to solve, and write a software that gives you the ability to transfer ideas into real world.*>
