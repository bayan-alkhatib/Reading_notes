 <! --comment-- >

## Global Attributes:
- which are attributes that can be used on any element.
- Global Atttibutes:
  - the id attribute: It is used to uniquely identify that element from other elements on the page.
  - Class Attribute: Sometimes, rather than uniquely identifying one element within a document, you will want a way to identify several elements as being different
    from the other elements on the page.
  - Block Elements: Some elements will always appear to start on a new line in the browser window. These are known as block level elements , Examples of block 
     elements are:   
      <h1>, <p>, <ul>, and <li>.
  - Inline Elements: Some elements will always appear to continue the same line as their neighboring elements. These are known as inline elements. 
    Examples of inline elements are:
    <a>, <b>, <em>, and <img>.

## Elements that are used to group together parts of the page:
  Div: The "div" element allows you to group a set of elements together
in one block-level box, the contents of the <div> element will start on
a new line, but other than this it will make no difference to the presentation of the page.
Span: The "span" element acts like an inline equivalent of the <div>
element. It is used to either:
1. Contain a section of text where there is no other suitable element to differentiate it from its surrounding text.
2. Contain several inline elements.

## Adding characters such as angled brackets and copyright Symbols.

# Chapter 17

- new HTML5 layout : HTML5 introduces a new set of elements that allow you to divide up the parts of a page. The names of these elements indicate the kind of content you will find in them. They are still subject to change, but that has not stopped many web page authors using them already.
- The new elements provide clearer code (compared with using multiple <div> elements). Ex. of new elements: footer, header. section , nav ..
- How to ensure older browsers recognize these elements:
 the new HTML5 elements will automatically treat them as inline elements. Therefore, to help older browsers, you should include the line of CSS on the left which states which new elements should be rendered as block-level elements.

 # Chapter 18

 ## Who is the Site For?
 Every website should be designed for the target audienceâ€”not just for yourself or the site owner. It is therefore very important to
understand who your target audience is. Why people visiting your website: Now that you know who your visitors are, you need to consider why they are coming. While some people will simply chance across your
website, most will visit for a specific reason.

## What Your Visitors are Trying to Achieve?
It is unlikely that you will be able to list every reason why someone visits your site but you are looking for key tasks and motivations. This
information can help guide your site designs.

## What Information Your Visitors Need?
You know who is coming to your site and why they are coming, so now you need to work out what information they need to achieve their goals quickly and effectively.

## How Often People Will Visit Your Site?
Some sites benefit from being updated more frequently than others. Some information (such as news) may be constantly changing, while other content remains relatively static.

## Site Maps:
Now that you know what needs to appear on your site, you can start to organize the information into sections or pages.

## Wireframes:
A wireframe is a simple sketch of the key information that needs to go on each page of a site. It shows the hierarchy of the information and how much space it might require.


## *Getting your message across using design?*
The primary aim of any kind of visual design is to communicate. Organizing and prioritizing information on a page helps users understand
its importance and what order to read it in.

## Other Notes:
1. Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
2. You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
3. You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
